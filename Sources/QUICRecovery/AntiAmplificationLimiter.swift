/// Anti-Amplification Limit (RFC 9000 Section 8.1)
///
/// Before address validation is complete, an endpoint MUST NOT send
/// more than three times the number of bytes received, to prevent
/// amplification attacks.
///
/// This limit applies only to servers during the handshake:
/// - Servers must limit response size until client address is validated
/// - Clients are not subject to this limit (they initiate the connection)
/// - The limit is lifted once the handshake is confirmed
///
/// ## Usage
///
/// ```swift
/// let limiter = AntiAmplificationLimiter(isServer: true)
///
/// // When receiving data
/// limiter.recordBytesReceived(1200)
///
/// // Before sending, check if allowed
/// if limiter.canSend(bytes: 1200) {
///     // Send the packet
///     limiter.recordBytesSent(1200)
/// }
///
/// // After handshake completion
/// limiter.confirmHandshake()
/// ```
